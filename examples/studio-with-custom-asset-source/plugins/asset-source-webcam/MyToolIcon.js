 * Couple of things to note:
 * - width and height is set to 1em
 * - fill is `currentColor` - this will ensure that the icon looks uniform and
 *   that the hover/active state works. You can of course render anything you
 *   would like here, but for plugins that are to be used in more than one
 *   studio, we suggest these rules are followed
