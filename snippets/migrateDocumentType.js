// Run this script with: `sanity exec --with-user-token migrations/migrate-document-type.js`
//
// This example shows how you can perform a migration where a document _type field is changing
//
// This will migrate documents in batches of 10 and continue patching until no more documents are
// returned from the query.
//
// A few things to note:
// - Changing the _type field on a document isn't allowed. The solution to this is to create a duplicate
//   with a new _id and _type, then delete the old document and patch all referencing documents with the new _id
// - This script will exit if any of the patches on the referencing documents fail due to a revision mismatch
//   (which means the document was edited between fetch => update)
// - The query must eventually return an empty set, or else this script will continue indefinitely
// - There's no guard against loosing data on the old, as it might change between fetch and create of new
